# üìä **Credit Risk Modeling Project**

## üìö **Overview**
This project focuses on building a **Credit Risk Model** to assess the **Probability of Default (PD)**, **Loss Given Default (LGD)**, and **Expected Credit Loss (ECL)**. The model is designed to evaluate the risk associated with loan portfolios and enable financial institutions to make data-driven lending decisions.

## üõ†Ô∏è **What is Credit Risk Modeling?**
- **Probability of Default (PD):** Measures the likelihood that a borrower will default on a loan.
- **Loss Given Default (LGD):** Estimates the proportion of the loan that will not be recovered if the borrower defaults.
- **Expected Credit Loss (ECL):** Combines PD, LGD, and Exposure at Default (EAD) to calculate the anticipated loss.

**Why this matters:** Accurate credit risk modeling helps financial institutions minimize losses, optimize lending strategies, and ensure regulatory compliance (e.g., Basel III framework).

## üìä **Project Steps**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Preprocessing**
- Handled missing values and ensured data consistency.
- Applied **label encoding** to categorical variables for machine learning compatibility.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Feature Engineering**
- **Employment Length (emp_length_int):** Categorized into discrete groups.
- **Months Since Issue (mths_since_issue_d):** Binned into meaningful intervals.
- **Interest Rate (int_rate):** Segmented into predefined ranges.


### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Binary Indicator Creation**
- Created binary columns indicating specific ranges for key variables.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Transformation**
- Used `pd.cut` to bin continuous variables into categorical intervals.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Modeling Preparation**
- Engineered features and prepared the dataset for models like **Logistic Regression**, **LightGBM**, and **XGBoost**.

### **Steps to Run the Project:**
1. Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
2. Execute preprocessing and feature engineering scripts.
3. Train machine learning models using the engineered features.
4. Evaluate model performance with metrics like **AUC-ROC**, **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1-Score**.

### **Expected Outcome:**
- Accurate prediction of loan default probabilities.
- Risk segmentation to support decision-making.
- Insights into key factors influencing credit risk.
